/**
 * SECTION: qgraph.h
 * @title: Qtest Driver Framework
 * @short_description: interfaces to organize drivers and tests
 *                     as nodes in a graph
 *
 * This Qgraph API provides all basic functions to create a graph
 * and instantiate nodes representing machines, drivers and tests
 * representing their relations with CONSUMES, PRODUCES, and CONTAINS
 * edges.
 *
 * The idea is to have a framework where each test asks for a specific
 * driver, and the framework takes care of allocating the proper devices
 * required and passing the correct command line arguments to QEMU.
 *
 * A node can be of four types:
 * - QNODE_MACHINE:   for example "arm/raspi2"
 * - QNODE_DRIVER:    for example "generic-sdhci"
 * - QNODE_INTERFACE: for example "sdhci" (interface for all "-sdhci" drivers)
 *                     an interface is not explicitly created, it will be auto-
 *                     matically instantiated when a node consumes or produces
 *                     it.
 * - QNODE_TEST:      for example "sdhci-test", consumes an interface and tests
 *                    the functions provided
 *
 * Notes for the nodes:
 * - QNODE_MACHINE: each machine struct must have a QGuestAllocator and
 *                  implement get_driver to return the allocator passing
 *                  "memory". The function can also return NULL if the
 *                  allocator is not set.
 * - QNODE_DRIVER:  driver names must be unique, and machines and nodes
 *                  planned to be "consumed" by other nodes must match QEMU
 *                  drivers name, otherwise they won't be discovered
 *
 * An edge relation between two nodes (drivers or machines) X and Y can be:
 * - X CONSUMES Y: Y can be plugged into X
 * - X PRODUCES Y: X provides the interface Y
 * - X CONTAINS Y: Y is part of X component
 *
 * Basic framework steps are the following:
 * - All nodes and edges are created in their respective
 *   machine/driver/test files
 * - The framework starts QEMU and asks for a list of available devices
 *   and machines (note that only machines and "consumed" nodes are mapped
 *   1:1 with QEMU devices)
 * - The framework walks the graph starting from the available machines and
 *   performs a Depth First Search for tests
 * - Once a test is found, the path is walked again and all drivers are
 *   allocated accordingly and the final interface is passed to the test
 * - The test is executed
 * - Unused objects are cleaned and the path discovery is continued
 *
 * Depending on the QEMU binary used, only some drivers/machines will be
 * available and only test that are reached by them will be executed.

 *
 * Assuming there the binary is

 * a valid test path will be:
 * "/x86_64/pc/other_node/my_driver/my_interface/my_test".
 *
 * Additional examples are also in libqos/test-qgraph.c
 *
 * Command line:
 * Command line is built by using node names and optional arguments
 * passed by the user when building the edges.
 *
 * There are three types of command line arguments:
 * - in node      : created from the node name. For example, machines will
 *                  have "-M <machine>" to its command line, while devices
 *                  "-device <device>". It is automatically done by the
 *                   framework.
 * - after node   : added as additional argument to the node name.
 *                  This argument is added optionally when creating edges,
 *                  by setting the parameter @after_cmd_line and
 *                  @extra_edge_opts in #QOSGraphEdgeOptions.
 *                  The framework automatically adds
 *                  a comma before @extra_edge_opts,
 *                  because it is going to add attributes
 *                  after the destination node pointed by
 *                  the edge containing these options, and automatically
 *                  adds a space before @after_cmd_line, because it
 *                  adds an additional device, not an attribute.
 * - before node  : added as additional argument to the node name.
 *                  This argument is added optionally when creating edges,
 *                  by setting the parameter @before_cmd_line in
 *                  #QOSGraphEdgeOptions. This attribute
 *                  is going to add attributes before the destination node
 *                  pointed by the edge containing these options. It is
 *                  helpful to commands that are not node-representable,
 *                  such as "-fdsev" or "-netdev".
 *
 * While adding command line in edges is always used, not all nodes names are
 * used in every path walk: this is because the contained or produced ones
 * are already added by QEMU, so only nodes that "consumes" will be used to
 * build the command line. Also, nodes that will have { "abstract" : true }
 * as QMP attribute will loose their command line, since they are not proper
 * devices to be added in QEMU.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 QOSGraphEdgeOptions opts = {
     .arg = NULL,
     .size_arg = 0,
     .after_cmd_line = "-device other",
     .before_cmd_line = "-netdev something",
     .extra_edge_opts = "addr=04.0",
 };
 QOSGraphNode * node = qos_node_create_driver("my_node", constructor);
 qos_node_consumes_args("my_node", "interface", &opts);
 *
 * Will produce the following command line:
 * "-netdev something -device my_node,addr=04.0 -device other"
