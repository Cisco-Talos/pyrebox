/**
 * SECTION:object.h
 * @title:Base Object Type System
 * @short_description: interfaces for creating new types and objects
 *
 * The QEMU Object Model provides a framework for registering user creatable
 * types and instantiating objects from those types.  QOM provides the following
 * features:
 *
 *  - System for dynamically registering types
 *  - Support for single-inheritance of types
 *  - Multiple inheritance of stateless interfaces
 *
 * <example>
 *   <title>Creating a minimal type</title>
 *   <programlisting>
 * #include "qdev.h"
 *
 * #define TYPE_MY_DEVICE "my-device"
 *
 * // No new virtual functions: we can reuse the typedef for the
 * // superclass.
 * typedef DeviceClass MyDeviceClass;
 * typedef struct MyDevice
 * {
 *     DeviceState parent;
 *
 *     int reg0, reg1, reg2;
 * } MyDevice;
 *
 * static const TypeInfo my_device_info = {
 *     .name = TYPE_MY_DEVICE,
 *     .parent = TYPE_DEVICE,
 *     .instance_size = sizeof(MyDevice),
 * };
 *
 * static void my_device_register_types(void)
 * {
 *     type_register_static(&my_device_info);
 * }
 *
 * type_init(my_device_register_types)
 *   </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * In the above example, we create a simple type that is described by #TypeInfo.
 * #TypeInfo describes information about the type including what it inherits
 * from, the instance and class size, and constructor/destructor hooks.
 *
 * Alternatively several static types could be registered using helper macro
 * DEFINE_TYPES()
 *
 * <example>
 *   <programlisting>
 * static const TypeInfo device_types_info[] = {
 *     {
 *         .name = TYPE_MY_DEVICE_A,
 *         .parent = TYPE_DEVICE,
 *         .instance_size = sizeof(MyDeviceA),
 *     },
 *     {
 *         .name = TYPE_MY_DEVICE_B,
 *         .parent = TYPE_DEVICE,
 *         .instance_size = sizeof(MyDeviceB),
 *     },
 * };
 *
 * DEFINE_TYPES(device_types_info)
 *   </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * Every type has an #ObjectClass associated with it.  #ObjectClass derivatives
 * are instantiated dynamically but there is only ever one instance for any
 * given type.  The #ObjectClass typically holds a table of function pointers
 * for the virtual methods implemented by this type.
 *
 * Using object_new(), a new #Object derivative will be instantiated.  You can
 * cast an #Object to a subclass (or base-class) type using
 * object_dynamic_cast().  You typically want to define macro wrappers around
 * OBJECT_CHECK() and OBJECT_CLASS_CHECK() to make it easier to convert to a
 * specific type:
 *
 * <example>
 *   <title>Typecasting macros</title>
 *   <programlisting>
 *    #define MY_DEVICE_GET_CLASS(obj) \
 *       OBJECT_GET_CLASS(MyDeviceClass, obj, TYPE_MY_DEVICE)
 *    #define MY_DEVICE_CLASS(klass) \
 *       OBJECT_CLASS_CHECK(MyDeviceClass, klass, TYPE_MY_DEVICE)
 *    #define MY_DEVICE(obj) \
 *       OBJECT_CHECK(MyDevice, obj, TYPE_MY_DEVICE)
 *   </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * # Class Initialization #
 *
 * Before an object is initialized, the class for the object must be
 * initialized.  There is only one class object for all instance objects
 * that is created lazily.
 *
 * Classes are initialized by first initializing any parent classes (if
 * necessary).  After the parent class object has initialized, it will be
 * copied into the current class object and any additional storage in the
 * class object is zero filled.
 *
 * The effect of this is that classes automatically inherit any virtual
 * function pointers that the parent class has already initialized.  All
 * other fields will be zero filled.
 *
 * Once all of the parent classes have been initialized, #TypeInfo::class_init
 * is called to let the class being instantiated provide default initialize for
 * its virtual functions.  Here is how the above example might be modified
 * to introduce an overridden virtual function:
 *
 * <example>
 *   <title>Overriding a virtual function</title>
 *   <programlisting>
 * #include "qdev.h"
 *
 * void my_device_class_init(ObjectClass *klass, void *class_data)
 * {
 *     DeviceClass *dc = DEVICE_CLASS(klass);
 *     dc->reset = my_device_reset;
 * }
 *
 * static const TypeInfo my_device_info = {
 *     .name = TYPE_MY_DEVICE,
 *     .parent = TYPE_DEVICE,
 *     .instance_size = sizeof(MyDevice),
 *     .class_init = my_device_class_init,
 * };
 *   </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * Introducing new virtual methods requires a class to define its own
 * struct and to add a .class_size member to the #TypeInfo.  Each method
 * will also have a wrapper function to call it easily:
 *
 * <example>
 *   <title>Defining an abstract class</title>
 *   <programlisting>
 * #include "qdev.h"
 *
 * typedef struct MyDeviceClass
 * {
 *     DeviceClass parent;
 *
 *     void (*frobnicate) (MyDevice *obj);
 * } MyDeviceClass;
 *
 * static const TypeInfo my_device_info = {
 *     .name = TYPE_MY_DEVICE,
 *     .parent = TYPE_DEVICE,
 *     .instance_size = sizeof(MyDevice),
 *     .abstract = true, // or set a default in my_device_class_init
 *     .class_size = sizeof(MyDeviceClass),
 * };
 *
 * void my_device_frobnicate(MyDevice *obj)
 * {
 *     MyDeviceClass *klass = MY_DEVICE_GET_CLASS(obj);
 *
 *     klass->frobnicate(obj);
 * }
 *   </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * # Interfaces #
 *
 * Interfaces allow a limited form of multiple inheritance.  Instances are
 * similar to normal types except for the fact that are only defined by
 * their classes and never carry any state.  You can dynamically cast an object
 * to one of its #Interface types and vice versa.
 *
 * # Methods #
 *
 * A <emphasis>method</emphasis> is a function within the namespace scope of
 * a class. It usually operates on the object instance by passing it as a
 * strongly-typed first argument.
 * If it does not operate on an object instance, it is dubbed
 * <emphasis>class method</emphasis>.
 *
 * Methods cannot be overloaded. That is, the #ObjectClass and method name
 * uniquely identity the function to be called; the signature does not vary
 * except for trailing varargs.
 *
 * Methods are always <emphasis>virtual</emphasis>. Overriding a method in
 * #TypeInfo.class_init of a subclass leads to any user of the class obtained
 * via OBJECT_GET_CLASS() accessing the overridden function.
 * The original function is not automatically invoked. It is the responsibility
 * of the overriding class to determine whether and when to invoke the method
 * being overridden.
 *
 * To invoke the method being overridden, the preferred solution is to store
 * the original value in the overriding class before overriding the method.
 * This corresponds to |[ {super,base}.method(...) ]| in Java and C#
 * respectively; this frees the overriding class from hardcoding its parent
 * class, which someone might choose to change at some point.
 *
 * <example>
 *   <title>Overriding a virtual method</title>
 *   <programlisting>
 * typedef struct MyState MyState;
 *
 * typedef void (*MyDoSomething)(MyState *obj);
 *
 * typedef struct MyClass {
 *     ObjectClass parent_class;
 *
 *     MyDoSomething do_something;
 * } MyClass;
 *
 * static void my_do_something(MyState *obj)
 * {
 *     // do something
 * }
 *
 * static void my_class_init(ObjectClass *oc, void *data)
 * {
 *     MyClass *mc = MY_CLASS(oc);
 *
 *     mc->do_something = my_do_something;
 * }
 *
 * static const TypeInfo my_type_info = {
 *     .name = TYPE_MY,
 *     .parent = TYPE_OBJECT,
 *     .instance_size = sizeof(MyState),
 *     .class_size = sizeof(MyClass),
 *     .class_init = my_class_init,
 * };
 *
 * typedef struct DerivedClass {
 *     MyClass parent_class;
 *
 *     MyDoSomething parent_do_something;
 * } DerivedClass;
 *
 * static void derived_do_something(MyState *obj)
 * {
 *     DerivedClass *dc = DERIVED_GET_CLASS(obj);
 *
 *     // do something here
 *     dc->parent_do_something(obj);
 *     // do something else here
 * }
 *
 * static void derived_class_init(ObjectClass *oc, void *data)
 * {
 *     MyClass *mc = MY_CLASS(oc);
 *     DerivedClass *dc = DERIVED_CLASS(oc);
 *
 *     dc->parent_do_something = mc->do_something;
 *     mc->do_something = derived_do_something;
 * }
 *
 * static const TypeInfo derived_type_info = {
 *     .name = TYPE_DERIVED,
 *     .parent = TYPE_MY,
 *     .class_size = sizeof(DerivedClass),
 *     .class_init = derived_class_init,
 * };
 *   </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * Alternatively, object_class_by_name() can be used to obtain the class and
 * its non-overridden methods for a specific type. This would correspond to
 * |[ MyClass::method(...) ]| in C++.
 *
 * The first example of such a QOM method was #CPUClass.reset,
 * another example is #DeviceClass.realize.
