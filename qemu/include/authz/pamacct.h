/**
 * QAuthZPAM:
 *
 * This authorization driver provides a PAM mechanism
 * for granting access by matching user names against a
 * list of globs. Each match rule has an associated policy
 * and a catch all policy applies if no rule matches
 *
 * To create an instance of this class via QMP:
 *
 *  {
 *    "execute": "object-add",
 *    "arguments": {
 *      "qom-type": "authz-pam",
 *      "id": "authz0",
 *      "parameters": {
 *        "service": "qemu-vnc-tls"
 *      }
 *    }
 *  }
 *
 * The driver only uses the PAM "account" verification
 * subsystem. The above config would require a config
 * file /etc/pam.d/qemu-vnc-tls. For a simple file
 * lookup it would contain
 *
 *   account requisite  pam_listfile.so item=user sense=allow \
 *           file=/etc/qemu/vnc.allow
 *
 * The external file would then contain a list of usernames.
 * If x509 cert was being used as the username, a suitable
 * entry would match the distinguish name:
 *
 *  CN=laptop.berrange.com,O=Berrange Home,L=London,ST=London,C=GB
 *
 * On the command line it can be created using
 *
 *   -object authz-pam,id=authz0,service=qemu-vnc-tls
 *
