# QEMU documentation build configuration file, created by
# sphinx-quickstart on Thu Jan 31 16:40:14 2019.
#
# This config file can be used in one of two ways:
# (1) as a common config file which is included by the conf.py
# for each of QEMU's manuals: in this case sphinx-build is run multiple
# times, once per subdirectory.
# (2) as a top level conf file which will result in building all
# the manuals into a single document: in this case sphinx-build is
# run once, on the top-level docs directory.
#
# QEMU's makefiles take option (1), which allows us to install
# only the ones the user cares about (in particular we don't want
# to ship the 'devel' manual to end-users).
# Third-party sites such as readthedocs.org will take option (2).
#
#
# This file is execfile()d with the current directory set to its
# containing dir.
#
# Note that not all possible configuration values are present in this
# autogenerated file.
#
# All configuration values have a default; values that are commented out
# serve to show the default.
