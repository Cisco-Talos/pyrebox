PCI IDs for qemu
================

Red Hat, Inc. donates a part of its device ID range to qemu, to be used for
virtual devices.  The vendor IDs are 1af4 (formerly Qumranet ID) and 1b36.

Contact Gerd Hoffmann <kraxel@redhat.com> to get a device ID assigned
for your devices.

1af4 vendor ID
--------------

The 1000 -> 10ff device ID range is used as follows for virtio-pci devices.
Note that this allocation separate from the virtio device IDs, which are
maintained as part of the virtio specification.

1af4:1000  network device (legacy)
1af4:1001  block device (legacy)
1af4:1002  balloon device (legacy)
1af4:1003  console device (legacy)
1af4:1004  SCSI host bus adapter device (legacy)
1af4:1005  entropy generator device (legacy)
1af4:1009  9p filesystem device (legacy)

1af4:1041  network device (modern)
1af4:1042  block device (modern)
1af4:1043  console device (modern)
1af4:1044  entropy generator device (modern)
1af4:1045  balloon device (modern)
1af4:1048  SCSI host bus adapter device (modern)
1af4:1049  9p filesystem device (modern)
1af4:1050  virtio gpu device (modern)
1af4:1052  virtio input device (modern)

1af4:10f0  Available for experimental usage without registration.  Must get
   to      official ID when the code leaves the test lab (i.e. when seeking
1af4:10ff  upstream merge or shipping a distro/product) to avoid conflicts.

1af4:1100  Used as PCI Subsystem ID for existing hardware devices emulated
           by qemu.

1af4:1110  ivshmem device (shared memory, docs/specs/ivshmem-spec.txt)

All other device IDs are reserved.

1b36 vendor ID
--------------

The 0000 -> 00ff device ID range is used as follows for QEMU-specific
PCI devices (other than virtio):

1b36:0001  PCI-PCI bridge
1b36:0002  PCI serial port (16550A) adapter (docs/specs/pci-serial.txt)
1b36:0003  PCI Dual-port 16550A adapter (docs/specs/pci-serial.txt)
1b36:0004  PCI Quad-port 16550A adapter (docs/specs/pci-serial.txt)
1b36:0005  PCI test device (docs/specs/pci-testdev.txt)
1b36:0006  PCI Rocker Ethernet switch device
1b36:0007  PCI SD Card Host Controller Interface (SDHCI)
1b36:0008  PCIe host bridge
1b36:0009  PCI Expander Bridge (-device pxb)
1b36:000a  PCI-PCI bridge (multiseat)
1b36:000b  PCIe Expander Bridge (-device pxb-pcie)
1b36:000d  PCI xhci usb host adapter
1b36:000f  mdpy (mdev sample device), linux/samples/vfio-mdev/mdpy.c

All these devices are documented in docs/specs.

The 0100 device ID is used for the QXL video card device.
