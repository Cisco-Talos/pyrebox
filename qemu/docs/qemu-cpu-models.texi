QEMU / KVM virtualization supports two ways to configure CPU models

@table @option

@item Host passthrough

This passes the host CPU model features, model, stepping, exactly to the
guest. Note that KVM may filter out some host CPU model features if they
cannot be supported with virtualization. Live migration is unsafe when
this mode is used as libvirt / QEMU cannot guarantee a stable CPU is
exposed to the guest across hosts. This is the recommended CPU to use,
provided live migration is not required.

@item Named model

QEMU comes with a number of predefined named CPU models, that typically
refer to specific generations of hardware released by Intel and AMD.
These allow the guest VMs to have a degree of isolation from the host CPU,
allowing greater flexibility in live migrating between hosts with differing
hardware.
@end table

In both cases, it is possible to optionally add or remove individual CPU
features, to alter what is presented to the guest by default.

Libvirt supports a third way to configure CPU models known as "Host model".
This uses the QEMU "Named model" feature, automatically picking a CPU model
that is similar the host CPU, and then adding extra features to approximate
the host model as closely as possible. This does not guarantee the CPU family,
stepping, etc will precisely match the host CPU, as they would with "Host
passthrough", but gives much of the benefit of passthrough, while making
live migration safe.

@subsection Recommendations for KVM CPU model configuration on x86 hosts

The information that follows provides recommendations for configuring
CPU models on x86 hosts. The goals are to maximise performance, while
protecting guest OS against various CPU hardware flaws, and optionally
enabling live migration between hosts with heterogeneous CPU models.

@subsubsection Preferred CPU models for Intel x86 hosts

The following CPU models are preferred for use on Intel hosts. Administrators /
applications are recommended to use the CPU model that matches the generation
of the host CPUs in use. In a deployment with a mixture of host CPU models
between machines, if live migration compatibility is required, use the newest
CPU model that is compatible across all desired hosts.

@subsubsection Important CPU features for Intel x86 hosts

The following are important CPU features that should be used on Intel x86
hosts, when available in the host CPU. Some of them require explicit
configuration to enable, as they are not included by default in some, or all,
of the named CPU models listed above. In general all of these features are
included if using "Host passthrough" or "Host model".


@table @option

@item @code{pcid}

Recommended to mitigate the cost of the Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) fix

Included by default in Haswell, Broadwell & Skylake Intel CPU models.

Should be explicitly turned on for Westmere, SandyBridge, and IvyBridge
Intel CPU models. Note that some desktop/mobile Westmere CPUs cannot
support this feature.


@item @code{spec-ctrl}

Required to enable the Spectre v2 (CVE-2017-5715) fix.

Included by default in Intel CPU models with -IBRS suffix.

Must be explicitly turned on for Intel CPU models without -IBRS suffix.

Requires the host CPU microcode to support this feature before it
can be used for guest CPUs.


@item @code{stibp}

Required to enable stronger Spectre v2 (CVE-2017-5715) fixes in some
operating systems.

Must be explicitly turned on for all Intel CPU models.

Requires the host CPU microcode to support this feature before it
can be used for guest CPUs.


@item @code{ssbd}

Required to enable the CVE-2018-3639 fix

Not included by default in any Intel CPU model.

Must be explicitly turned on for all Intel CPU models.

Requires the host CPU microcode to support this feature before it
can be used for guest CPUs.


@item @code{pdpe1gb}

Recommended to allow guest OS to use 1GB size pages

Not included by default in any Intel CPU model.

Should be explicitly turned on for all Intel CPU models.

Note that not all CPU hardware will support this feature.

@subsubsection Important CPU features for AMD x86 hosts

The following are important CPU features that should be used on AMD x86
hosts, when available in the host CPU. Some of them require explicit
configuration to enable, as they are not included by default in some, or all,
of the named CPU models listed above. In general all of these features are
included if using "Host passthrough" or "Host model".


@table @option

@item @code{ibpb}

Required to enable the Spectre v2 (CVE-2017-5715) fix.

Included by default in AMD CPU models with -IBPB suffix.

Must be explicitly turned on for AMD CPU models without -IBPB suffix.

Requires the host CPU microcode to support this feature before it
can be used for guest CPUs.


@item @code{stibp}

Required to enable stronger Spectre v2 (CVE-2017-5715) fixes in some
operating systems.

Must be explicitly turned on for all AMD CPU models.

Requires the host CPU microcode to support this feature before it
can be used for guest CPUs.


@item @code{virt-ssbd}

Required to enable the CVE-2018-3639 fix

Not included by default in any AMD CPU model.

Must be explicitly turned on for all AMD CPU models.

This should be provided to guests, even if amd-ssbd is also
provided, for maximum guest compatibility.

Note for some QEMU / libvirt versions, this must be force enabled
when when using "Host model", because this is a virtual feature
that doesn't exist in the physical host CPUs.


@item @code{amd-ssbd}

Required to enable the CVE-2018-3639 fix

Not included by default in any AMD CPU model.

Must be explicitly turned on for all AMD CPU models.

This provides higher performance than virt-ssbd so should be
exposed to guests whenever available in the host. virt-ssbd
should none the less also be exposed for maximum guest
compatibility as some kernels only know about virt-ssbd.


@item @code{amd-no-ssb}

Recommended to indicate the host is not vulnerable CVE-2018-3639

Not included by default in any AMD CPU model.

Future hardware generations of CPU will not be vulnerable to
CVE-2018-3639, and thus the guest should be told not to enable
its mitigations, by exposing amd-no-ssb. This is mutually
exclusive with virt-ssbd and amd-ssbd.


@item @code{pdpe1gb}

Recommended to allow guest OS to use 1GB size pages

Not included by default in any AMD CPU model.

Should be explicitly turned on for all AMD CPU models.

Note that not all CPU hardware will support this feature.

@node default_cpu_models_x86
@subsubsection Default x86 CPU models

The default QEMU CPU models are designed such that they can run on all hosts.
If an application does not wish to do perform any host compatibility checks
before launching guests, the default is guaranteed to work.

The default CPU models will, however, leave the guest OS vulnerable to various
CPU hardware flaws, so their use is strongly discouraged. Applications should
follow the earlier guidance to setup a better CPU configuration, with host
passthrough recommended if live migration is not needed.
