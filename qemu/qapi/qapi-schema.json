# = Introduction
#
# This document describes all commands currently supported by QMP.
#
# Most of the time their usage is exactly the same as in the user Monitor, this
# means that any other document which also describe commands (the manpage,
# QEMU's manual, etc) can and should be consulted.
#
# QMP has two types of commands: regular and query commands. Regular commands
# usually change the Virtual Machine's state someway, while query commands just
# return information. The sections below are divided accordingly.
#
# It's important to observe that all communication examples are formatted in
# a reader-friendly way, so that they're easier to understand. However, in real
# protocol usage, they're emitted as a single line.
#
# Also, the following notation is used to denote data flow:
#
# Example:
#
# | -> data issued by the Client
# | <- Server data response
#
# Please, refer to the QMP specification (docs/interop/qmp-spec.txt) for
# detailed information on the Server command and response formats.
#
# = Stability Considerations
#
# The current QMP command set (described in this file) may be useful for a
# number of use cases, however it's limited and several commands have bad
# defined semantics, specially with regard to command completion.
#
# These problems are going to be solved incrementally in the next QEMU releases
# and we're going to establish a deprecation policy for badly defined commands.
#
# If you're planning to adopt QMP, please observe the following:
#
#     1. The deprecation policy will take effect and be documented soon, please
#        check the documentation of each used command as soon as a new release of
#        QEMU is available
#
#     2. DO NOT rely on anything which is not explicit documented
#
#     3. Errors, in special, are not documented. Applications should NOT check
#        for specific errors classes or data (it's strongly recommended to only
#        check for the "error" key)

# include it first right here.
